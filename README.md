## Chrome Quick Text Linker

### TL;DR

This extension is inteded for lovers of keyboard shortcuts and people (devs?) who
hate to use mouse / trackpad.

### What is this for?

This chrome extension is inteded to make it very easy to access websites you
frequently visit.  You may wonder "why do I need this if Chrome remembers when
I type things like 'facebook' and auto-completes?"

While that works fine if your accessing a website via it's root domain.  But if
you frequently use sites that have a subdomain that you don't wanna have to
remember such as "somesubdomain.example.com" or something more complex where
you have for example 2 google accounts with different calendars, while you could
use the interface to toggle them, it's actually much easier to remember a short-
cut like "cal" (for calendar) or "wcal" for work calendar for example.

You may find other helpful use cases and the best part is that if you set up
a [keyboard shortcut](https://chodounsky.net/2015/03/24/add-keyboard-shortcut-to-chrome-extension/) you can jump quikcly to just about anywhere in a new tab in a matter of a couple of keystrokes.
